module sage::plugins_test;

// NOTE: The QuickJS plugin host (`sage_qjs_*`) is implemented in native C and is
// linked only into the `sage` executable build target (via `build.slk`).
//
// `silk test` compiles each language-level `test` into its own standalone
// executable without those native `[[target]].inputs`, so a true integration
// test that invokes the plugin host currently fails at load time with an
// undefined symbol error.
//
// Keep this module as a placeholder for future integration tests once the test
// runner can link native inputs.
